# Assignment8_PentestingLiveTargets
# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: _Session Hijacking/Fixation_________________

- [ ] Summary: This website is vulnerable to session hijacking because you can use a PHPSESSIONID from one browser (eg. Chrome) while logging on as an admin, and then use a different browser (eg. Firefox) to input the PHPSESSIONID to log on..
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: 
  	![](session.gif)
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: 
  		1. Log on as pperson in a browser.
  		2. Keep the "public/hacktools/change_session_id.php" open in a different tab and copy it.
  		3. In a different browser (Chrome, firefox, safari), navigate to the "public/hacktools/change_session_id.php" page and enter the session id from the earlier step.
  		4. Navigate to the public site and click "Login"
  		5. You should be logged into the sales system.

Vulnerability #2: __SQLi________________

- [ ] Summary: This website is also vulnerable to simple SQL injection.  The id value entered in the browser is not properly validated.  This means we can use SQL injection to input malicious SQL into the id parameter 
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: 
  	![](sqli.gif)
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: 
  		1. Log on as pperson in a browser.
  		2. Navigate to a profile of a salesperson (Ken Barker in this case)
  		3. In the id parameter in the browser change the number to ' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'
  - [ ] Affected source code:

## Green

Vulnerability #1: __XSS________________

- [ ] Summary: The green website is vulnerable to an XSS attack in that we can use the Contact page to inject malicious XSS code.  THis will cause a logged in user, when they navigate to the Contact page, to receive a XSS alert.
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: 
  	![](xss.gif)
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: 
  		1. Navigate to the Contact page and fill out the form.
  		2. For the "Feedback" portion enter '<script>alert('MALLY HAS FOUND THE XSS!');</script>'
  		3. The logged on user will now see an XSS alert everytime they visit the Contact Page
  - [ ] Affected source code:


Vulnerability #2: __User Enumeration_______________

- [ ] Summary: The green website is also vulnerable to an XSS attack because failed login when both username and password are wrong  provide a differently formatted error message as opposed to when there is a failed login with the wrong password.  This makes it easy to decipher if the username is correct.
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: 
  	![](userenum.gif)
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: 
  		1. On the Login form, enter 'jmonroe99' (which is a valid username) and any password and click Submit.
  		2. Notice that "Log in was unsuccessful" is bolded.
  		3. Next, try enterring only 'jmonroe' (invalid username) and any password and click Submit.
  		4. Notice that the "Log in was unsuccessful" is not bolded this time.
  - [ ] Affected source code:
## Red

Vulnerability #1: __Insecure Direct Object Reference________________

- [ ] Summary: This one is vulnerable to a Insecure Direct Object Reference attack.  This is because it doesn't properly validate whether a "id" value entered in the browser translates to a salesman whose information is public or private.  This makes it easy for an attacker to view private information about a salesman.
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: 
  	![](idor.gif)
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: 
  		1. CLick on any salesmans profile on the "Find a salesperson" page.
  		2. Change the "id" parameter in the browser to any value.
  		3. Notice that the id values 10 and 11 link to profiles of salespersons whose information is private. 
  - [ ] Affected source code:

Vulnerability #1: __Cross Site Request Forgery________________

- [ ] Summary: This website is also vulnerable to a cross site request forgery attack.  This is because the website doesn't correctly validate the Cross Site Request FOrgery token allowing attackers to change information in the database of the application.
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: 
  	![](csrf.gif)
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: 
  		1. On the Contact page, (not logged on), fill out the form, and in the feedback portion, provide a link to the following html code.  [Link 1](https://gyazo.com/740bce7292b445d4f1fe887e981e4b94)
  		2. In this case we will edit the information, for id=2 which is Sherry Travino
  		3. Now when someone logs on as pperson, and navigates to the Feedback, and visits the linked HTML page, the information for Sherry Travino will change.
  		4. Should change the name to Sorry Travino!, the email to "sorry@travino.com", and the phone number to 123-123-1234
